# Dan's Config Files
Where Dan keeps his configs. :joy:

## AutoHotKey
File: `fastaf.ahk`

Why: I like to use the Mouse4 and Mouse5 buttons for Ctrl and Alt respectively.

### Run on startup (on windows)
1. Press `Win+R` to open Run dialog
2. Type `shell:startup` and press enter
3. Paste the shortcut of the `fastaf.ahk`
